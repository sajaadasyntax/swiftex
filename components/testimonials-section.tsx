            Having built strong experience working within the gas and plumbing industry, including exposure to high standards expected by large national service providers such as British Gas, we recognised the importance of treating customers as individuals rather than numbers.

          <p className="mt-6 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            This experience allows us to understand systems thoroughly and offer a tailored, personal service that larger companies often cannot provide. At Swiftfix Plumbing Ltd, every customer receives honest advice and solutions designed specifically for their property and needs.
